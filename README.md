Idea: Use Coherence between sensors as a prediction metric, combined with standard predictors, non-linear predictors such as Lyapunov exponents and etc, along with standard spectral data. Dimensionality reduction with UMAP, and then CV/prediction with sklearn's new HistGradientBoostingRegressor.

To do: Compare/implement/integrate leaderboard techniques and see where this could be improved!
